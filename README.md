# OrdAll

The title is a Haskell pun.

Ranking things is annoying. Rarely can you say something is the 17th best. But
you *can* say it's better than another thing. So this program simply asks you
that to rank things.

## Example usage

Enter name of list of things to rank
> movies

Enter thing to rank:
> the rock with Sean Connery

Is it better than 'ghost rider with nick cage'? (y/n)
> y

Is it better than 'thank you for smoking'? (y/n)
> n

All done. 'the rock with Sean Connery' is the 12th highest ranked in the list
'movies' (of the stuff you've ranked so far).
